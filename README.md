# Movie Recommendation System

## Summary

The movie recommendation system uses collaborative filtering to recommend movies to users based on their past history of movie ratings. 

## Background

One of the most common problems for movie-goers is deciding what movie to watch. With an overwhelming number of movies available on various platforms, it can be difficult to choose a movie that one would enjoy. Our recommendation system solves this problem by suggesting movies based on a user's movie history and the history of other users who have similar tastes. This system will be especially useful for people who are new to a platform and don't know what to watch, as well as for those who are overwhelmed by the amount of content available on the platform. 

## How is it used?

The user inputs their movie ratings into the system, and the system suggests movies based on the user's previous ratings and the ratings of other users who have similar preferences. The system is useful for people who want to explore new content and for those who want to discover movies that they would like based on their past preferences. 

## Data sources and AI methods

The data is taken from the MovieLens dataset, which contains ratings for over 27,000 movies from over 138,000 users. The AI method used is collaborative filtering, which analyzes the data to find patterns in movie preferences among users. 

## Challenges

One limitation of the system is that it only recommends movies that are similar to the user's past ratings, which may not necessarily be what the user is looking for. Additionally, there may be biases in the dataset, as some movies may be more popular than others, leading to more ratings and potentially skewing the recommendations. 

Ethical considerations include ensuring that the system does not recommend movies that contain sensitive content such as hate speech or harmful stereotypes. It is important to also ensure that the system does not perpetuate existing biases and discrimination in the film industry. 

## What next?

The system can be improved by incorporating user feedback and adjusting the recommendations accordingly. It can also be expanded to include more data sources and to incorporate additional AI methods such as content-based filtering. The project can be further developed by implementing a user interface for users to input their ratings and receive recommendations.
